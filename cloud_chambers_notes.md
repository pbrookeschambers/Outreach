## cloud formation
- Water vapour can condense to form liquid water
- Much more likely to happen when the concentration of water vapour is very high
- Usually needs a surface onto which to condense
    - Hence, condensation forms on objects
- In clouds, this can be small dust particles
- Charged particles also induce condensation

## radioactivity

- Radioactive decay is a random process
- Produces alpha, beta and gamma radiation (plus some others)
- Alpha radiation is heavy and charged
    - Therefore, perfect for inducing condensation
- By placing a radioactive source in an area of very high humidity, we can see a trail of cloud whenever an alpha particle is emitted
- We'll use isopropyl alcohol instead of water, as it evaporates much more quickly

## instructions

- Spread a scoop of dry ice over the polystyrene block
    - SAFETY: dry ice is very cold, and can cause frostbite. Wear gloves, closed-toe shoes, and safety glasses. 
- Place the metal sheet on top of the dry ice and push down gently
    - SAFETY: This will produce a **very** loud noise. If you are sensitive to loud noises, wear ear protection
- Once the metal sheet has cooled to the same temperature as the dry ice, the noise will mostly stop.
- saturate the felt lining of the acrylic box with isopropyl alcohol
    - SAFETY: isopropyl alcohol is flammable, and toxic if ingested. Wear gloves, and always wash your hands after the activity
- Place the radioactive source in the middle of the metal sheet
- Place a ruler next to it, perpendicular to the source rod
- Cover the source with the acrylic box
- Wait for a few minutes

### observations

- Should see trails of cloud shooting out from the source
- They are different lengths; why?
- Can you work out the initial speed of the alpha particles, assuming that all excess energy is converted into kinetic energy?

### Cosmic rays

- Remove the source from the box.
- top up the isopropyl alcohol if needed
- Replace the box, now empty, and watch carefully
- You should occasionally see trails of cloud vertically through the box
- What might these be?
- Why are they much more rare and faint?
