\title{Cloud Chambers}
\description{%
See alpha radiation travel through the air, leaving trails of cloud behind. A
radioactive source is placed in a clear box filled with isopropyl alcohol vapour
and chilled with dry ice. The emitted alpha particles ionise the vapour, causing
it to condense into thin trails of cloud which are visible for a few secons.
Cosmic rays can also sometimes be seen. }
